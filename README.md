## Home Bartender
This is the front-end javascript portion of my Home Bartender Application. The backend Rails Api, code can be found at https://github.com/Lyoung0789/bartender-backend.git. 

Home Bartender is an Application where you can post your favorite cocktail recipe for other aspiring mixologists to try. 
Users are able to view others recipes and their ingredients, as well as like and add/view comments on individuals cocktails. 
You may share your favorite recipe by clicking the "Add Recipe!" button and filling out the form shown. 

Home Bartender was designed for all levels of mixologists and is driven by its community. 

Thank you so much for trying out Home Bartender!
